# Sources and licences

The skill `obk-tdd` was consolidated for this kit from these, all MIT, with
thanks:

- **mattpocock/skills**, `engineering/tdd`: seams and where tests go, vertical
  slices against bulk testing, the tautological and implementation-coupled
  shapes, refactoring outside the loop, standing in only at system boundaries,
  and not testing everything so the effort lands on the paths that matter. Its
  `to-spec`: the existing seam preferred, the highest one, and the fewer the
  better. Its `diagnosing-bugs`: the correct seam for a bug test, and no
  correct seam being the finding.

  (reconstructed: the research pack's 2026-09-20 clone the skills were built
  from; the revision actually read was not recorded)
- **obra/superpowers**, `test-driven-development` and its `writing-good-tests`:
  naming the break a test catches, deriving the expected value by hand, change
  detectors, behaviour rather than text, your contract rather than the
  framework's, the four rules about a stand-in, the list of warning signs, and
  the mutation classes. Its `verification-before-completion`: the
  revert-the-fix proof. Its `writing-plans`: a requirement's silence not being
  permission, and the few uncovered input classes most likely to bite.

  (reconstructed: the research pack's 2026-09-20 clone the skills were built
  from; the revision actually read was not recorded)
- **Cursor pstack**, `tdd` and `principle-test-behavior-not-implementation`:
  the five shapes that observe no behaviour and the fix for each (asserting
  what a stand-in received rather than that it was called, and the relation
  across rows of data that is kept), "prefer no
  new test over a bad test", the honest exit when a test is impractical, and
  the report that names the failing-before and passing-after runs.

  (reconstructed: the research pack's 2026-09-20 clone the skills were built
  from; the revision actually read was not recorded)
- **addyosmani/agent-skills**, `test-driven-development` and
  `constraint-driven-development`: finding out how the project tests before
  writing anything, repetition being no fault in a test, a subagent for the
  reproduction test, and the cheap roads to green.

  (reconstructed: the research pack's 2026-09-20 clone the skills were built
  from; the revision actually read was not recorded)
- **citypaul/.dotfiles**, `tdd` and `mutation-testing` with its
  `mutator-rules`: the mutation loop, survivor triage into killed, equivalent
  or named and deferred, the equivalence question, the high-value logic worth
  breaking, the inputs that tell a break apart (either side of a boundary,
  mixed true and false, no identity values), the tool-run mechanics in
  `mutation-tools.md`, keeping the harness out of the inner loop, triangulating
  after a fake, and refusing to manufacture a red.

- **Kent Beck's own rules file**: one test at a time, the smallest code that
  passes, structure and behaviour kept apart, and the two-level test for a
  defect.

Our own, with no source behind them: the order to break things in, the red
from an archived baseline for behaviour that already existed, checking that an
author's hand-back is in the change (from this repo's issues #115 and #119),
and the part on work away from code.
