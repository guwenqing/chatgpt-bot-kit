// The daily grooming run (PRD 6.8): an optional pass that reads what the bots
// have been doing, works out what it cost, and tells Bot Father.
//
// It runs on Claude Code's own scheduler, in a session of Bot Father's called
// `grooming`, because the owner decided that scheduled work does not use an
// Orca automation: an automation cannot carry a model or an effort of its own,
// and a session's launch line can (#223). The user adds that session like any
// other, with the model and effort it is to run at, and brings it up; the kit
// never makes, starts or closes it.
//
// So the kit schedules nothing itself. The job is the session's: its own
// `CronCreate`, which lives in the running Claude Code and only while its tab is
// up, comes back on a resume, and outlives a `/clear` (tech notes, section 2).
// The kit reads which grooming jobs there are out of the transcripts of the
// conversations that process has had, and when asked it types one line into the
// grooming tab: schedule, unschedule, run once, or compact. It keeps no copy of
// what is scheduled, so what it reports is what the conversation holds.
//
// A line typed into the tab is run when the session gets to it, which may be
// after the kit has typed another, so what the kit read from the transcript
// when it typed can be out of date: an `--on` not yet run leaves no job to see.
// So the lines that schedule and unschedule say what the schedule is to be
// rather than what to change: when the session runs one, it looks at what it
// has itself (CronList), removes every grooming job, and then makes the one
// asked for, or none. Run in any order, the last one typed is what holds
// (review of PR #322).
//
// A job can make its runs on Codex instead (#238, PRD 6.8): the session stays the
// Claude Code one, the clock and the reader, and at each fire it makes the run
// as a temporary Codex session of its own (`obk temp make`), with the job's
// model and effort on the run's launch line. The run does the grooming, sends
// its report back by the kit's mail and is retired by the session, which first
// retires any run an earlier fire left. What the runs are on is in the job's
// prompt and nowhere else, so the kit reads it back from there.
//
// Claude Code ends a recurring job a week after it was made, so the job's own
// prompt ends by renewing it. A renewal that fails either way shows here: no
// job means the fleet has quietly stopped being groomed, two mean it is groomed
// twice, and both are said plainly.
