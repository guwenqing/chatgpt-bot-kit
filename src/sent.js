// `obk session sent`: what the kit's PostToolUse hook says after a session's
// native message (#451, ADR 0032).
//
// Claude Code's own messaging reaches every Claude session on the machine, not
// only the sessions of one bots folder. After a send to another session, this
// looks at where it went: to a session address none of the fleet's books name,
// the session is told so, with the road the kit would have given it. The send
// has gone either way. Nothing here decides anything about it, and anything it
// cannot read is silence (ADR 0022: a hook never disturbs the session).
//
// It reads the send from its fields, never from its wording. Seen on Claude
// Code 2.1.283: a send to an in-process teammate answers with a `routing`
// object, and one to another session without it; the input's `to` names the
// target, as a session's name with an optional ` [xxxxxx]` reference, or as a
// `uds:` socket path when answering a message, which no book can map.
