// A session whose book names a mailbox Run this Orca does not have gets a new
// one from its mailbox step, and only then (issue #508).
//
// A fleet moved to a new machine keeps its bots folder, and with it each
// book's `mailbox:`, an Orca Run. The Runs live in the old machine's Orca, so
// the new Orca has none of them. The launch line's first step, `obk session
// mailbox`, binds the book's Run with `run-use`, Orca refuses, and the step
// fails "unchanged" on every start, for ever: the kit makes a Run only for a
// session whose book names none.
//
// Orca 1.4.223 refuses `run-use` in one set of words for a Run it does not
// have and for a legacy, inspect-only Run it does have (read in its bundle;
// helpers/fake-orca.js models both). Only `run-show` tells them apart: it
// refuses the first with `run_not_found` and answers the second. So what these
// tests pin is:
//
//   1. Replace only on "not found". The book names a Run, `run-use` is
//      refused, and `run-show` is refused with `run_not_found`: the step makes
//      a Run in this tab, writes it into the book as the session's `mailbox`,
//      and answers `change: 'replaced'`, `mailbox` the new id and `replaced`
//      the old one. Its plain line names both ids. In every other case nothing
//      is made, the book is not changed, and the step fails as it did before:
//      `run-use` timed out ("may now be bound"); `run-show` answered the Run
//      (a legacy Run); `run-show` timed out or was refused with another code
//      ("unchanged").
//   2. Safe with two at once. The new Run is written under the book's lock,
//      and only while the book still names the stale Run and this tab. When
//      another writer replaced it first, the book keeps theirs, the step binds
//      that one to this tab and answers `change: 'bound'`, and its own new Run
//      is left unused. When the book moved to another tab, nothing is written
//      and the step fails naming the Run it made, as the made-Run path does.
//   3. History stays. Only the session's `mailbox` changes: its other keys and
//      the book's `retired:` entries are as they were.
//
// The wording is the kit's; what is pinned is the ids, the exit code and the
// book. Mail sent to the old Runs is out of scope. Each step runs as coder's
// own tab, with that tab's ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE and ORCA_TAB_ID, against the
// fake Orca. Two tests wait out the step's twenty-second limit on one Orca
// call, as the hang tests in mailbox-attestation.test.js do.
