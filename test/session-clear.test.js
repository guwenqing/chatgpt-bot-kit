// `obk session clear` and `obk session compact`: the kit, not the harness, is
// asked to clear or compact a session, and does it safely (#391).
//
//   obk session clear   --bots <path> --bot <bot> --session <name> [--json]
//   obk session compact --bots <path> --bot <bot> --session <name> [--json]
//
// The requirement, with the architect's rulings, as these tests hold it:
//
//   - All three flags are needed, and a missing one is refused the way every
//     command refuses one. Both commands are in `obk --help`.
//   - Refused before anything is typed (non-zero exit, a reason, nothing sent
//     into any tab): an unknown bot or session, a paused bot or session, a
//     session with no tab open, and a tab with only its shell in front (the
//     harness quit; the reason says a restart brings it back).
//   - Then it waits, up to 30 s, for the session to be idle with nothing on its
//     screen to answer. Busy is Orca's `tui-idle` not answering ok, or any
//     screen row saying "esc to interrupt" in any case, since Orca can call a
//     busy Codex idle. A question or form on screen (as the kit's own look
//     sees one), or a reason Orca gives for a blocked tab, is waited out too.
//     Still not idle at 30 s: refused, nothing typed, and it says why. One that
//     goes idle within the 30 s goes on.
//   - It types the harness's own command as text, with no return: `/clear` on
//     Claude Code, `/new` on Codex, `/compact` on both. It types it one
//     character a send, never the whole command in one, with a gap between
//     sends past Codex's paste-burst window (Codex 0.160.0: 8 ms between
//     characters, a 60 ms idle flush; the kit uses 100 ms or more), and each
//     character goes through the typing gate first: a look with Orca's
//     `terminal wait --for tui-idle`. The slash menu is not a question to the
//     gate. If the gate refuses partway (busy, a question, cannot tell), it
//     stops and takes back exactly the characters typed so far, that many
//     backspaces (\x7f) in one send, and refuses (the architect's ruling on
//     #391, 2026-10-03).
//   - Then it reads the screen, by the architect's ruling after live run 4.
//     Claude Code: the input line (the lowest row its pointer `❯` starts),
//     read with a non-breaking space after the pointer as a space, reads
//     exactly `❯ /clear`; above the input box's top rule, the first row whose
//     first text starts with `/` names exactly that command as its first word
//     (a wrapped description row is no command row). Codex: before the first
//     character its input line was empty or its placeholder, with no draft;
//     after typing, the popup's selected row (the nearest `›` row above the
//     input line) names exactly the command and is the popup's only command
//     row, and the input line reads exactly `› /new`, or `›` alone on Codex
//     0.160.0, whose screen read shows no composer text while the popup is
//     open (the version as the session's current rollout gives it).
//     Otherwise it takes the text back with one backspace per character, as
//     one send, and refuses, saying what the screen showed, its last rows
//     among it. A compact the menu does not offer is "this harness cannot
//     compact".
//   - The return is a send of its own: `\r`, without --enter.
//   - Codex's clear: when "Where should the new conversation run?" comes up
//     with the pointer on "1. Current checkout", one more `\r`; with the
//     pointer anywhere else, Esc (\x1b) and a refusal, never `2`. Then, because
//     Codex reports a new conversation only at its first turn (tech notes,
//     section 3), RECORD_LINE below, word for word (approved by the architect
//     on #391), with a return, through the
//     gate the mail notice goes through. Nothing like it on Claude Code.
//   - A clear is confirmed by the book: within 30 s it holds a conversation id
//     for the session other than the one it held before anything was typed.
//     `--json` answers `{ bots, cleared: { bot, session, harness, was, now } }`.
//     None in 30 s: non-zero, saying the command was entered, the book has no
//     new conversation, and to look at the tab.
//   - A compact is confirmed by the harness's own record of the session's
//     current conversation: within 300 s it gains a compaction made after the
//     command began (Claude Code's `compact_boundary` line, Codex's top-level
//     `compacted` record). `--json` answers `{ bots, compacted: { bot,
//     session, harness, conversation, confirmed: true } }`. None in the 300 s
//     is not a failure: exit 0, `confirmed: false`, and the plain answer says
//     the compaction is "not confirmed yet" (the architect's ruling on #391,
//     comment 5963852753). That case is not tested here, since it costs the
//     whole 300 s; the live system test reports it when it happens.
//   - Nothing goes into any tab but the session's own.
//   - A cleared session is not promised to be idle afterwards (a Codex one may
//     run its start routine), so nothing here asks that of it: a clear is the
//     book's new id.
//
// How the harness is played here. The fake Orca types nothing anywhere and
// runs no hook. Each send into the session's tab can move its screen on
// (`nextScreens`, helpers/fake-orca.js), so the screens a harness would show
// as the command is typed, entered and answered are given in order, from
// helpers/screens.js; the typed-command screens there are reconstructions.
// The harness's part after the return (the hook reporting a new
// conversation, or a compaction written to its record) is played by the test
// while the command waits: it watches the tab's sends and acts once the step
// that would cause it has been sent.
//
// How the wait is modelled. The fake Orca keeps no clock: its `terminal wait`
// answers at once. So a tab that goes idle in time is a `waitIdle` list
// (busy on the first looks, idle after), and one that never does costs the
// full 30 s of real time. Those tests are few, and run
// side by side at the end of this file.
//
// Every expected value comes from the requirement: the commands typed, the
// keys, the line's words and the JSON's shape.

// those later reads. An at-work row or a question that shows there did not

// same read that passes the input-line and menu rule, shows no at-work row
// and no question, on every read while it waits for the menu; otherwise no
// Return, the command is taken back, and the refusal names the signal.
//
// How it is modelled. After the last character the screen is first drawn
// without the menu, the command in the input line and nothing above it, for
// one read; every read after that shows the menu drawn, and with it the
// signal. So whatever the kit reads first, the first screen that passes the
// input-line and menu rule carries the signal, and a kit that reads on until
// the menu is drawn cannot accept a screen without it.

// ------------------------------------- Claude Code 2.1.296's menu pointer (#510)
//
// Claude Code 2.1.296 marks the selected row of its slash menu with a pointer,
// `  ❯ /compact`, above the input box's top rule. Its input line under the
// rule reads `❯` alone whatever is in it, and Orca 1.4.223's screen read gives
// the line's text as `draft` beside the rows, leaving the key out when the
// line is empty (helpers/screens.js, the 2.1.296 captures). The architect's
// final ruling on #510, as these tests hold it:
//
//   - The menu's selected row, above the input box's top rule, is its pointer
//     row when it has one, and its first command row when it has none, as on
//     2.1.288. Its first word is exactly the command: not `/compact-x`, not
//     `/autocompact`. A refusal on the menu names the selected row.
//   - The input line's text is Orca's `draft` when the read gives one, and it
//     equals the command exactly. With no `draft`, the line is read from the
//     rows as before: `❯ /compact`, with a space or a non-breaking space,
//     passes, and a bare `❯` is refused.
//   - Before the first key: a read that gives a non-empty `draft` means the
//     user has a draft in the line. Refused, nothing typed into the tab at
//     all, and the refusal says the input line holds a draft.
//   - Not tied to a Claude Code version, and `/clear` is read as `/compact` is.
//     Codex is as it was.
//
// The screens while the command is typed are whileTyping's, on 2.1.288's
// layout and with no draft: the probes read the screen only once the whole
// command was in, and the looks between characters ask the gate only. A
// refused command's backspaces put up the read taken after them.

// ---------------------------------- Codex 0.162.0 and Orca's draft (#516)
//
// Codex 0.162.0 under Orca 1.4.223, as a live probe for #516 showed it
// (helpers/screens.js, the CODEX_162 captures): Orca's read gives the text of
// Codex's input line as `draft`, and the line's row then reads `›` alone. An
// empty line gives no `draft`. The popup for `/new` or `/compact` is the
// command's one row, selected, with the input line right under it and no
// blank row. The intent of #516, as these tests hold it, for clear (`/new`)
// and compact (`/compact`) on Codex:
//
//   - Before the first key: a non-empty `draft` means the user's draft is in
//     the line. Refused, nothing typed at all, and the refusal shows the
//     draft. This holds when the line's row reads `›` alone or the
//     placeholder.
//   - After typing, with a `draft`: it equals the command exactly, and the
//     popup's selected row names the command exactly and is its only command
//     row. Then the return goes in, and the clear or compact goes on as
//     before. On any Codex version: 0.162.0, 0.160.0, or one the rollout does
//     not give.
//   - A draft that is not exactly the command: the typed keys are taken back,
//     one backspace each in one send, no return, and the refusal shows the
//     draft. On 0.160.0 too, whose bare line is taken only with no draft.
//   - The right draft does not excuse a wrong popup: another command
//     selected, two command rows, or none. Taken back and refused.
//   - With no `draft`, the screen is read as before: a bare `›` is taken only
//     on 0.160.0. And 0.162.0's layout, with no blank row, is read the same.
//
// The reads while the command is typed are whileTypingCodex162's: the
// capture for "/", and then the command's row with the draft so far.

// ---------------------------------------------------- the review of PR #466
//
// Four gaps the review found. Each is the requirement as it stood, now with a
// test of its own:
//
//   - The 30 s wait for an idle session is a cutoff, not a count of looks, as
//     #421 ruled for the list line: a look that finds the session idle but
//     answers after the 30 s are up is too late, and nothing is typed.
//   - Every call the command makes to Orca is bounded. A screen read Orca does
//     not answer in time is "cannot tell": before anything is typed, it is no
//     reason to type; after the command is typed, the screen check cannot
//     pass, so the command is taken back, as for any screen that fails it. It
//     never holds the command for as long as Orca stays quiet.
//   - "A compaction made after the command began" means after /compact was
//     typed: one written while the kit still waits for the session to go idle
//     does not confirm it.
//   - The harness's record can be larger than one string holds (a live Codex
//     rollout of 1.28 GB, #396). A compaction after such a stretch still
//     confirms the compact.
