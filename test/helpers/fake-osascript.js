// A fake `osascript` for the ordinary suite. `OBK_OSASCRIPT` points every
// sandboxed run at it, so `npm test` never reaches the machine's own osascript,
// and through it System Events and the real Orca's menu (#343).
//
// The kit asks it one thing: force-reload the window of one Orca, through
// Orca's own menu item View › Force Reload. It runs
//
//   <osascript> <script file> <Orca.app path>
//
// the script being the kit's own file and the path the `.app` folder of the
// Orca CLI in use. Any other shape (no script file, an inline `-e`, more or
// fewer arguments, a path that is no `.app`, which is what the ordinary
// sandbox's CLI leads to until `orcaApp` lays one out) is refused here with
// exit 70, as the fake ps refuses a call it was never meant to get. Every
// call, refused or not, is written to osascript.log in the fake Orca's
// directory for a test to read as `{ args }`.
//
// It is a shell script, not Node, and writing the call down is the first thing
// it does. The kit gives osascript 5 s, and on a loaded machine a Node process
// can take longer than that to start (#381): a fake in Node was killed before
// it had written anything, and a test read no call where there was one. The
// shell is up in milliseconds, so the log says whether the kit ran osascript,
// and the answer a test told it is given, however busy the machine.
//
// What it answers is what a test told it, in osascript.answer beside the log,
// written by `answerScript`: `{ stdout, stderr, code, delayMs }`. `delayMs`
// holds the answer back that long, which with a long enough wait is an
// osascript that never answers; each answer it gets as far as giving is
// written to osascript-answered.log, so a test can tell a call that was killed
// from one that ran to its end. With nothing told it refuses, the way a Mac
// that has not given the kit Accessibility or Automation does: so an ordinary
// run hears the reload line it has always heard. The words of a refusal are
// illustrative; the kit is meant to read only the exit status and the answer
// on stdout.
