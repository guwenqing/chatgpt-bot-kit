 *                                  argument (#432). A Codex on a GPT-6 model
 *                                  told to wait calls its built-in `sleep` in
 *                                  its turn, for an hour or more, and the tests'
 *                                  waits for an idle tab never end. The kit's
 *                                  own launch line keeps the tool: the notice it
 *                                  types ends such a sleep (seen live, #432)
 *
 * Codex looks for trust at the session's folder and then at its git root, the
 * realpath first, so the bots folder's realpath covers every bot in it.
 *
 * `hooks: false` leaves the bypass out, for the one case that wants the hooks
 * untrusted: the folder is still trusted, so the review is shown and the hooks
 * do not run until they are trusted, and "Continue without trusting" writes
 * nothing (read in Codex 0.158.0's source for #240, not seen live).
 *
 * `sleep: true` leaves the sleep tool on, for the one session that checks a
 * real bot with it still gets its mail: codex-sleep.test.js's sleep-codex.
 *
 * The name says trust because trust is what it began as (#240); it is the
 * whole of what a system test's Codex session is launched with.
