// `obk restart` (and in T3 `obk pause` and `obk retire`, which close a
// session's tab the same way) when Orca refuses `terminal close --terminal <h>
// --tab` with tab_not_found for a tab it still lists (#405).
//
// Seen live on Orca 1.4.214, after a machine restart: `obk restart --session
// prep` stopped on `Orca refused terminal close --terminal term_… --tab:
// tab_not_found`, while `orca terminal list --json` listed that terminal with
// the book's tab id and `orphaned: false`. `orca terminal close --terminal
// term_…` without `--tab` worked, and `obk up` then brought the session back
// with its conversation. In Orca 1.4.215's code `terminal list` and `close
// --tab` look the tab up in two different places, so a listed tab can be
// refused; the refusal likely comes as code `runtime_error` with message
// `tab_not_found`, though a code of `tab_not_found` is possible too. For a tab
// of one pane, which is every tab the kit opens, the close without `--tab`
// closes the whole tab.
//
// The contract, from the issue and the architect's rulings on it and on its
// pull request (#413):
//
//   T1 A `--tab` close refused with tab_not_found for a tab Orca lists, and
//      only in one of two forms, error code `tab_not_found`, or code
//      `runtime_error` with a message that is exactly `tab_not_found`: the kit
//      closes the same terminal again without `--tab`, waits as ever until the
//      listing drops the tab, and goes on: a new tab, resuming the book's
//      conversation. Only that session's tab is closed, and never with
//      `--worktree … --all`.
//   T2 Every other refusal stops the restart as today, with one close and
//      nothing opened: a message that only carries the token, at its end or
//      inside a longer message, and the letters inside another word, included.
//   T3 Both closes refused, in any command that closes a session's tab
//      (restart, pause, retire): it stops with nothing opened, names both
//      refusals and the exact close to run by hand, and says to run the same
//      command again, which, once that close is done, goes through. It never
//      tells the user to run `up` in place of a pause or a retire.
//   T4 The tab still listed when the wait after the plain close runs out: the
//      restart stops as for any close the listing never catches up with.
//
// The refusal is the fake Orca's `refuseClose`, which one terminal carries
// (helpers/fake-orca.js): the trigger state itself was not produced live.
