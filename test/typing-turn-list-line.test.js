// The list line waits its turn to type (#482).
//
// The owner's intent on #482: two kit paths never type into the same
// session's tab at once, since each kit line is a whole line with its own
// Return, and one that lands in the middle of another submits a mixed line.
// #480 gave each session a typing turn (helpers/typing-turn.js); the naming
// and the mail nudge take it (typing-turn.test.js). The boundary, in the
// owner's words: "every kit path that types into a session's tab takes #480's
// typing turn. When it's held, a path waits a short, bounded time, then
// reports 'not typed: the kit is typing into it' through the trouble report it
// already has, and types nothing."
//
// This file is the list line: when `up` (and `restart`, `unpause`, the same
// path) resumes a Codex session in a new tab, the kit types one line into it
// so Orca lists it (codex-resume-list-line.test.js). Before it types, it takes
// the session's typing turn, waiting the same 5 s as the nudge:
//
//   - not got: nothing is typed after the launch line, the tab's `--json`
//     entry has `listLine: false` and a `listLineTrouble` that says the kit is
//     typing into it, the plain report says so under the tab, and `up` still
//     succeeds;
//   - got within the 5 s (here let go after about 1 s): the line is typed as
//     it is today;
//   - per session: a turn held for another session of the bot does not stop
//     this one.
//
// The turn is held from the test process, as typing-turn.test.js holds it.
// Every run is in the sandbox, with a fake Orca.
